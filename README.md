This is a single-page web App for my Phase-1 project at Flatiron School.<br>
This App uses APIs from Open Brewery DB (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).<br>
This App will allow a user to search for breweries registered to the Brewers Association.


The basic story of your application:<br>
    A web application to discover breweries and track the ones you have visited

The core features of your MVP:<br>
    - Random brewery is displayed on page load<br>
    - Users will be able to add their favorite Breweries to a 'Favorites list'<br>
    - Users will be able to toggle whether or not they have visited a Brewery<br>
    - Users will be able to search for a Brewery by Name, Location, Type<br>
    - When user selects a Brewery, additional details will be displayed; full address, phone#, link to website<br>
    - Users will be able to submit reviews about a favorited/visited brewery<br>
    
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it:<br>
    - Data will come from Open Brewery DB https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries<br>
    - Lists of Visited & Favorited breweries & User reviews will be saved to json file<br>

Challenges you expect to face:<br>
    - Cases of incomplete data for some breweries<br>
    - Filtering search results<br>
    - Managing Visited and Favorites list overlaps<br>


Stretch Goals:<br>
    - User can update missing information
    
Commands: <br>
Start json server:`json-server --watch db.json`<br>
