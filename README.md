This is a single-page web App for my Phase-1 project at Flatiron School.  
This App uses APIs from Open Brewery DB (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).
This App will allow a user to search for breweries registered to the Brewers Association.


The basic story of your application:
    A web application to discover breweries and track the ones you have visited

The core features of your MVP:
    Random brewery is displayed on page load
    Users will be able to add their favorite Breweries to a 'Favorites list'
    Users will be able to toggle whether or not they have visited a Brewery
    Users will be able to search for a Brewery by Name, Location, Type
        When user selects a Brewery, additional details will be displayed; full address, phone#, link to website
    Users will be able to submit reviews about a favorited/visited brewery
    
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it:
    Data will come from Open Brewery DB https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries
    Lists of Visited & Favorited breweries & User reviews will be saved to json file

Challenges you expect to face:
    Cases of incomplete data for some breweries
    Filtering search results
    Managing Visited and Favorites list overlaps


Stretch Goals:
    User can update missing information
